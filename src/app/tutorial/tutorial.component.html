    <h1>What is Draftmon ?</h1>
    <span>
      Draftmon allows you to create or join rooms where you can draft
      competitive pokemon sets.
    </span>
    <p>
      The objective is to build the strongest team by strategically selecting
      pokemons.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each player opens their first pack, chooses a pokemon, then passes the
        rest to the next player.
      </li>
      <li>
        Players then receive pokemon from the preceding player, choose another
        one, and pass the remainder along again.
      </li>
      <li>
        This process repeats for each pokemon in the pack and for each pack...
        The direction of rotation swaps with each new pack!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At the end of the draft, you can export your team in a format compatible
      with Pokemon Showdown and compete with the players you drafted with.
