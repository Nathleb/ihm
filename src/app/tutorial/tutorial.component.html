    <h1>What is Draftmon ?</h1>
    <span>
      In Draftmon you create or join rooms where you can draft competitive
      pokemon sets.
    </span>
    <p>
      The objective is to build the strongest team by strategically selecting
      pokemons.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each player opens their first pack, chooses a pokemon, then passes the
        rest to the next player.
      </li>
      <li>
        Players then receive pokemons from the preceding player, choose another
        one, and pass the remainder along again.
      </li>
      <li>
        This process repeats for each pokemon in the pack and for each pack...
        The direction of rotation swaps with each new pack!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The key to success here is making the right decisions. Pokémon have
      different types, moves, statistics, items, and abilities, and it's up to
      you to choose the one that will join your team. Will you prioritize raw
      power over synergies? Will you compensate for your weaknesses or go all in
      on your strengths?
    </p>
    <p>
      You now have a pool of available pokemons to compute your final six. Once
      your team ready, you can export it in a format compatible with Pokemon
      Showdown and compete with the players you drafted with.
